# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

This project is a good way to show and reinforce basic CSS and HTML as well as expanding with more advanced things such as animation and adding forms. i believe this project covers a good amount of content in a shortform way. with that being said i belive that it would be a good idea to focus more on forms and being able to implement submission of the form as well as maybe focusing on some more animation portions.
